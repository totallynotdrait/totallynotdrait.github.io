            <p>I always wanted to make my own 'cool' 90s style website where i describe my self, what i do and the project that im making, so here we are. I wanted to have my own domain and TDL, but i had to pay, which was ok to me but i didn't understand how payment works, like if i pay a certain quantity or full price. So at the end i used GitHub Pages because it's free and easy to use. Now the website it's pretty boring, gray white it's a nice style for me but kinda boring, i will make a lot of changes in the site with time in time like adding more badges, info page and a new website style.</p>
