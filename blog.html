            <p>It took me like a hour to make a new css style but here it is! The color pallete i've choosen is from the Catppuccin color palette, in particular the frappè one, i always use this theme on almost every program and also on Linux (i use arch btw) but i don't have a anime girl as a wallpaper like people usually do <b><span style="font-size: 13px; letter-spacing: 10px; color: #e5c890;">(wtf????)</span></b>, i have a old MacOS Server wallpaper that i've randomly found on a website.</p>

            <p>YHellow. It's been a while since made my last blog, so since im still alive i wanted to make a recap of this months, but first of all let's talk about the game. I've actually planned to continue on developing the game i was making on summer vacation, since i had more free time to work on thing (about 1 year i started on this project), but since i lost the project files, i need it to redo everything, from scripts to textures. But also i've stopped on working on the game because i was working on another big project that i was more appasionated, which is a hobby operating system written in C++ called Atlas (check the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/totallynotdrait/atlas-dev">here</a>). It's kinda going ok? But there are a lot of issues, ideas and things that i want to implement but the only problem is i don't know how to do it or im just lazzy. But also i've promised to change the CSS style of the website, which i will probably do it now. BTW i've recently started doing the genocide run of Undertale (best rpg game) but im stuck at <b style="color:red">UNDYNE THE UNDYING</b> so i don't really known how to fight her. And lastly for some reason my Corsair K60 Core broke, it started pressing random keys circa every minute, so i contacted Corsair Client Support and now they're replacing my K60 Core with a K70 Core because they recently stopped manufacturing and selling the K60 in Corsair official website, btw the keyboard they're sending to me via UPS comes from the Netherlands (<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Joost Klein®</span> reference? coincidence? i don't think so). I've also started streaming something on Twitch so if you want to check it out <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ait123">click here!</a>, i don't have a beast of graphics card and in some games the stream will actually frezze sooooooo i won't stream that much. So yeah that's all for now see you again after like 5/6 months!</p>

            <p>I always wanted to make my own 'cool' 90s style website where i describe my self, what i do and the project that im making, so here we are. I wanted to have my own domain and TDL, but i had to pay, which was ok to me but i didn't understand how payment works, like if i pay a certain quantity or full price. So at the end i used GitHub Pages because it's free and easy to use. Now the website it's pretty boring, gray white it's a nice style for me but kinda boring, i will make a lot of changes in the site with time in time like adding more badges, info page and a new website style.</p>
