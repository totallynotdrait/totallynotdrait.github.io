First projects were made in 2019, using CosmosOS .NET Framework. Nothing special about it, a simple shell.

In the end of 2023, Atlas was a BIOS booted Operating System with a very limited terminal output, user inputs, a GDT and IDT and a heap allocator.

In 2024 Atlas offical development started with a UEFI bootloader, GOP graphics, PS/2 Keyboard and Mouse, Interrupts, AHCI driver and more.

In the December of 2024, Atlas was rewritten, with the reason of beign "full of bugs, bloated, horrible code".

As of 04/05/2025, Atlas has the same things of the old version, but with the difference beign more stable. It has an advanced debugging features, a Window Manager with a renderer supporting Alpha Blending and Gaussian Blur, a dedicated GUI library for Atlas Window Manager, everything in kernel mode making Atlas a unique OS from others.
